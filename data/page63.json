For as long as you stay, I hope you enjoy your time.\n\nYour number one question should be whether or not you need my services. My number one question is have you finished your manuscript? If you can answer yes to that question, then you\u2019re in need of a book expert\u2014someone who is capable of editing your manuscript for:\n\n\u2756 Content (flow, character development, plot development, etc.), \n\u2756 Grammar (noun-verb agreement, danglers, tense, word usage, etc.), \n\u2756 Spelling (is it their, there, or they're?), \n\u2756 Punctuation (does that comma go there, is that the proper formatting for an ellipsis?),\n\u2756 Proper capitalization of terms (Government or government?),\n\u2756 Proper treatment of numbers (101 or one hundred and one?),\n\u2756 Proper formatting of foreign terms (avec vous?),\n\u2756 Quotations and dialogue formatting (single quotations for a quote inside of character speech or double?),\n\u2756 Reference formatting and fact checking,\n\u2756 And so many other editing errors I\u2019ve come across in my eight years of editing for authors.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m not just an editor. You see, I self-published years ago on various different platforms, and I transposed that skill I learned from my personal life into my professional one. I\u2019m capable of formatting your manuscript for electronic publication and paperback publication for the following platforms:\n\n\u2756 Amazon KDP\n\u2756 Barnes & Noble's Nook\n\u2756 Kobo\n\u2756 Smashwords\n\u2756 Lulu\n\u2756 BookBaby\n\nIf you are thinking of publishing on a different platform, I\u2019m a quick learner. Honestly, there are a few things to tweak here and there to make a document compatible on a different platform. Just ask, and I\u2019ll let you know if I can work my magic.\n\nInterested in my specs?\n\nI\u2019ve professionally content edited, line edited, copyedited, proofread, and formatted manuscripts for self-publication, submission to literary agents, and submission to publishers for the past eight years working with a myriad of different genres. I\u2019m always looking to learn something new.", "I am available Monday-Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST and Saturday from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. EST."]}}]}
