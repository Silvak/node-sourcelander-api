I\u2019m extremely motivated, organized and disciplined. On an individual level, I believe \u201copenness to experience\u201d as the single most important trait of exceptionally creative people. To have a high tolerance for uncertainty, which is as important an asset in creativity as openness to experience. To not know what lies ahead, gives us the fire to continue to create. Last but not least is cognitive flexibility, which is the ability to see the world of design and Illustration with new eyes. To view obstacles as opportunities! To transform random events, even mistakes, into the chance to veer in an entirely new and unexpected direction. To keep my mind and eyes open for new design and illustration experiences. No matter where I\u2019ve been, I\u2019ve produced topnotch work. Whether it\u2019s promotional work for external clients or internal corporate leave behinds, I pride myself on my ability to recognize and articulate a distinct voice for every project. And that\u2019s not always restricted to the design.  To speak of a creative leader or manger, is a paradox. Creativity is chaotic and unrestrained while leadership is orderly and controlling, and setting the two together makes for a potentially volatile combination. But it\u2019s what being a senior creative is all about. I relish the opportunity to lead and be creative, to embrace innovation and creativity as central missions of a company such as yours.
