I have also published a drama and a dramedy as well as a children's book. \n\nIn 2000, I was awarded my first book deal by John Gordon Burke Publisher. It was about new urbanism, an interesting way to design cities. That was my first actual taste of writing professionally and I have been enjoying it ever since. \n\nI have written over twenty books in my career that have led to some rather interesting experiences. I wrote one book for a former NFL player who is now a public speaker. Another interesting book was about discrimination in the workplace at one of the major corporations in America. \n\nI have also written over ten screenplays that include comedies, dramas, and thrillers. Last year, I wrote a drama about an undercover agent who gets so deep in the gangs of Miami that he has to be yanked out before he ends up in a gang war. It was a true story that led to one of the biggest drug busts in American History. \n\nAfter that, a producer asked if I would write a screenplay for her about conversion camps. She gave me the notes and I wrote the screenplay that is now in the hands of executives. \n\nThe screenplay I recently optioned is a thriller that a production company is excited about doing. I retained the rights for the book and that's what I suggest most people think about when they have a good idea. Write the book and the screenplay. Not only can I help you get your book published, but I can get you in touch with the producers who will want to see your screenplay.\n\nTestimonials:\nProducer for my thriller: \"It was a long process, but we\u2019re glad to have found you out of the crowd of 150! Let\u2019s make a film!\"\n\nProducer for the conversion camps film: \"The script is extremely great, very well written.\"", "When you contact me about your book or screenplay, you will get a very attentive writer who makes it a point to go over the details of your project meticulously. That's how I'm able to provide clients with what they envision and not my idea of what I think they'd like. \n\nWhen I give you a deadline, I will meet it. Most deadlines are set with buffer time to get through the challenges of writing an interesting story. In my years of experience, I know how long a project will take and I don't give unreasonable expectations.\n\nI have taken on rush jobs before. I always meet the deadline. But, we'd have to negotiate that and I'm open to it."]}}, {"id": 8, "user": {"name": "Technologic outsourcing", "metadata": ["Chicago, Islamabad, United States", "Chicago,", "Islamabad,", "United States", "881\n/yr", "881", "/yr", "\u00b7", "100%"], "avatar": "https://res.cloudinary.com/gurucom/image/upload/w_96,h_96,f_auto,dpr_2/v1649622100/pimg/FreelancerFiles/2/336/2336372/lxbkjepefregccsurfyo.jpg", "description": {"mainImg": "https://res.cloudinary.com/gurucom/image/upload/f_auto,dpr_2/pimg/2/336/2336372/logo%20for%20gym_dde76f87-17e6-4dfb-89e8-71d688031447.jpg", "title": "Lead Generator,Web Researcher Specialist", "description": ["$5/hr   \u00b7   Starting at $25", "Not only I can help you with my skills and knowledge in customer service but I can also work on Lead Generation, data entry and other admin works.
