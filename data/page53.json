I learned a great deal, on my own after college (my major was pre-law). I get bored, and I like a challenge.97% of when I bid on a project, I have already delivered a simple, or complex solution, that no one, including my fellow Freelancers could.\n\nAlso, I would rather us wok together to solve and prefect a n issue, for a good price, and hope that you remember me, in a month, or year..even if it's just to aske me to fix something simple, and say hello, than... \n\nI am kind of \"silly\" in my methods. Yes, I DO want to make money (I am sometimes silly, but not crazy). However.. I feel good, when I complete my projects in a fashion that, the project owner should not need anyone's services, for the present project for quite a while. And.. I always provide \"value added\"/anticipation of what will probably come next.. \n\nSemper Fi", "I ask this: I am VERY PRONE to giving above what is asked for. so, TELL ME what I am bidding on. If you want two things, don't post your project, for one. I will always give the one, in my power (and maybe more). HOWEVER, don't ask me for two, and three, without paying me for one.\n\nAnyway, I am very good, at what I bid for. i am also a good person, and generally like people, and do not bid unless I am certain..."]}}]}
