I did temp jobs for a while until I got hired with an insulation company in Addison, Illinois, where I worked and became office manager from 1999-2004. I excelled at helping grow the small family owned company. I taught the owners how to use their computer system, booked their 3 times a year trips, and iteniraries. After 3 years, I began doing phone quotes and selling attic fans by phone, making commission, which i really enjoyed, even though I always said I would never do sales jobs.  I relocated to SW Florida in 2004 as I could not stand the cold in Illinois any longer. I moved here, went to school for my dream job, \"Surgical Technologist\" , during my clinicals I developed plantar fasciitis in BOTH of my feet, and barely graduated. I was unable to keep the job I got after graduating due to the pain in both of my feet that was in 2006 and to this DAY I still have it.", "I guess this is another waste of time site that only has SCAMMERS ON IT. HOw ridiculous. WOW\nI will work ANY hours, and am very FAST and accurate, I am in desperate need of money and am confined to working at home as I lost my car and live in a rural area. I will do your work FAST and accurate. I only ask that you pay me a decent wage. I am not asking for alot but I need to get by until I get on disability, and my sister is requiring I pay her rent, any little bit will help. I prefer to be contacted any way,. email or phone. I am online daily and usually early AM also. IF you want a FAST turnaround please give me a chance."]}}]}
