Thank you.", "Thank you for your interest in working with AC. All clients for any project need to share their names, location, contact information and any details pertinent to the project.\n\nAgreements: For every project, I submit a proposal. After discussion, the client and I define the project's scope, budget and milestones with a clear project agreement (PA) that outlines the work to be completed, payment terms and is signed.\n\nBilling: AC accepts payment via SafePay Escrow. All funds need to be deposited in Escrow before final work is released. Short term projects are usually initiated with a 50% deposit upon commencement and 50% upon final delivery. First payment is non-refundable.\n\nProjects of a larger scope require 20-25% deposit and regular payment at intervals. AC works with clients at an hourly rate or per page rate. Payments are due ahead of time or on date of service for ongoing work. Add-on work beyond original scope is billed at an hourly rate of $75/hour.\n\nLate Payments: Invoices have 3 business days to be paid, after which a 5% late fee is applied. Future work agreements may be terminated at AC's discretion. If payment is not received within 15 days, work is stopped and outstanding payment due is sent to collections. The client is responsible for all collection and attorney fees.\n\nCancellation Fee: For content retainer projects, if the client wishes to terminate the contract early, the client must pay a cancellation fee equivalent to a payment of one's month work or 15% of the project value, whichever is the greater amount due. Cancellation requests must be given in writing 60 days prior. \n\nMeetings: Our first consultation is free. Subsequent meetings are billed. AC is available via email.\n\nThank you!"]}}, {"id": 12, "user": {"name": "Smart Bussiness", "metadata": ["Bhakkar, Pakistan", "Bhakkar,", "", "Pakistan", "2,490\n/yr", "2,490", "/yr", "\u00b7", "100%"], "avatar": "https://res.cloudinary.com/gurucom/image/upload/w_96,h_96,f_auto,dpr_2/v1678466499/pimg/FreelancerFiles/4/478/4478216/hji5drnqraooiwsn2ook.jpg", "description": {"mainImg": "https://res.cloudinary.com/gurucom/image/upload/f_auto,dpr_2/v1668256117/pimg/FreelancerFiles/4/478/4478216/dydewxiy28hchycltkug.webp", "title": "Articles & Blog Posts", "description": ["$5/hr   \u00b7   Starting at $25", "GET YOUR ARTICLE/BLOG POST WRITTEN BY A PROFESSIONAL!!\nIf you are looking for well Researched, SEO optimized, high quality and informative MEDICAL CONTENT, health related articles/blog, product descri\u2026"], "skills": ["Sales & Marketing", "Advertising Campaigns & Collateral", "Ad Design", "Advertising", "Advertising Campaigns", "Advertising Copy", "Advertising Ideas"]}}, "services": [{"title": "Cover Letters", "description": ["$5/hr   \u00b7   Starting at $25", "I understand how daunting the job application process can be!
