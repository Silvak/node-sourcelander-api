The reason why it happens is not because what client wants is not understood properly but because the project is never taken as 'it is my project'. It is never (well almost!) thought of what is going to be good and important for the system and the approach is 'the client or the specs did not mention that'.We want to change that, take a project and then treat it as if it is our own.
