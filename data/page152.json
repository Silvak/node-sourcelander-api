Today's customers are savvy yet many companies still operate as if little has changed. They opt to talk at customers instead of with them and tend to position themselves outside of the inner circle of what really matters to customer groups. We help to present your better self, integrate that identity across digital and traditional media and create new, exciting growth strategies.  \nWhile we see most innovation happening in startups to small businesses, we also see blind spots so assuming a position of active objectivity seems to close the gaps for clients. When we accept a client, we expect to see double digit growth as a result. current clients enjoy a 50-70% growth rate.\n\nWe require new clients to pay 50% down at the start of a project and the balance on completion.
