If my assumption is right, then you can rest assured that you are at the right place. In six years, I have written a lot of fiction stories, for my personal use and some others for friends. My inspirations include Nora Roberts, Sandra Brown, Anne Rice, Emmanuelle Arsan, and Danielle Steel. I want to help you breathe life into your characters, bring them to life, and make them as real as they could be. I have experience in writing Dark Romance, Mafia, Young Adult, Romantic Comedy, Chicklit, Contemporary, Alpha Male, Alpha Females, Urban, Billionaire, and Bad Boy Genres, but I can also write on several other genres like Werewolves, Sci-Fi, Christian, Adventure, and Paranormal. I am open to writing on other genres, and I ensure that I do my research methodically before putting my knowledge into words.\n\nIn Fiction, I am most active in the romance genres, I can write a fully fleshed out romance/erotica short story in less than a week (depending on the word count) and will put 110% effort into making a story that fits whatever you desire! I've written in countless genres and themes over the years, and it's safe to say that romance and adventure are the ones I'm the best at. I can also write other fiction stories like BBW, paranormal, gay/straight, BDSM, time travel, interracial, and others.\n\nMy services include\n-writing with or without an outline\n-a story with a unique and captivating writing style\n-a complete proofread for spelling, grammar, and any syntax errors\n-writing using any specifics you request\n- Plagiarism free work\n\nI am completely open-minded about any topics or details you wish to be added to your story and am always eager to help bring a new story to life, maybe you'll even surprise me!
