I graduated from Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, Florida with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Creative Writing. I\u2019m an award-winning newspaper reporter and an experienced medical, dental, and healthcare marketing writer, having worked with physicians, dentists, chiropractors, and other healthcare professionals in a wide range of specialties. Writing is not a hobby or side job for me; it is my full-time occupation.\n\nFor many years, I was active on Guru.com, earning a five-star rating for the quality of my work and customer service. After several years away from Guru.com, I\u2019ve reactivated my membership, and I look forward to assisting clients all around the country with their writing, editing, and proofreading tasks.\n\nMy goal is to help my clients present themselves and their products or services in the best possible light. I understand the importance of working with clients closely to achieve their goals. I also understand the importance of meeting deadlines. As a writer, I pride myself on working with clients who know what they want to say but don't know how to say it, and delivering clean, clear, concise, and engaging copy. As an editor, I have a knack for finding mistakes other editors miss. As a proofreader, I excel at scrutinizing proofs to ensure they\u2019re clean and ready for submission or self-publication.\n\nIn addition to my career as a freelance writer and editor, I also have a creative side. Earlier in my life, I was active in the Tampa Bay area as an arts organization manager and booker, emcee, performer, and recording artist. Scrapbook, my debut music and poetry CD, was released in 1998 and was followed by Thoughts From Seclusion in 2000, All Things To All People in 2003, and Drive in 2006.\n\nI enjoy cooking, collecting CDs and DVDs, dining out, rooting for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and continuing my quest for the perfect glass of iced tea.", "I work only with Employers who agree to use SafePay.\n\nI prefer to communicate via email three or four times a week. I work Monday through Friday \u2013 9:00am to 5:00pm EST \u2013 but my availability on Tuesday and Thursday is very limited. However, I\u2019m quick to answer Guru messages, so don't hesitate to write with any questions.\n\nHonest feedback from Employers is appreciated and will be reciprocated with honest feedback to Employers.\n\nCode of Ethics \u2013 I strive to deal openly and honestly with my Employers. I expect the same in return. I meet my Employers\u2019 deadlines. In return, I expect my Employers to release the agreed-upon funds at the agreed-upon time. Each project is a team effort. My Employer can expect me to live up to my responsibilities in completing the Employer\u2019s project. I expect the Employer (and the Employer\u2019s employees or agents) to live up to his or her responsibilities in completing the project. \n\nObjectionable Material \u2013 I reserve the right to decline working on material that in my sole judgment is offensive, objectionable, unethical, or illegal."]}}, {"id": 11, "user": {"name": "Ryan Metz", "metadata": ["Webster, United States", "Webster,", "", "United States", "1,980\n/yr", "1,980", "/yr"], "avatar": "https://res.cloudinary.com/gurucom/image/upload/w_96,h_96,f_auto,dpr_2/v1673480767/pimg/FreelancerFiles/1/734/1734001/mmqnuqclddwleylwgxjo.jpg", "description": {"mainImg": "https://res.cloudinary.com/gurucom/image/upload/f_auto,dpr_2/v1673481404/pimg/FreelancerFiles/1/734/1734001/fknjfsjvctje7xriskfp.png", "title": "Tech/Non-Tech Recruiting", "description": ["$30/hr   \u00b7   Starting at $55", "Full Desk/Lifecycle Recruiter/Career Coach - Manage and lead technical and non-technical recruitment requisitions.
