Each person has his or her own unique narrative behind the reasons to write.\n\nPeople like me who born to write always search for something meaningful,a longing to create something of value. Within each writer there exists an artist\u2019s heart and the spirit to share that heart with the world. \u201cIt is an intimate relationship that is formed between writer and reader.\u201d\n\nI started my career as a freelancer and  I\u2019ve done everything from books, articles, eBooks, blogs,websites, newspaper and magazine work, SEO content, editing, proofreading and more. \n\nAs a digital marketer I learn, when the reader begins scanning the words of the writer,this opens up the door for endless potential in that newly formed relationship.\n\nAs a Content provider,I have developed my writing skills with regards to creative, informative,technical, sales-oriented, and academic writing.\n\nAfter the learning of 7 years I know what it is like to be in the full flow of progressive thought and inspiration when opening the notebook or blank document to begin writing a new exciting piece I want to give to my readers\n\nMy core competencies focus on giving clients a voice in a unique way according to the specialized needs of the project. I love working one-on-one with small businesses, entrepreneurs,start-ups and driven individuals to help them flesh out ideas and bring their brand to a wider audience.\n\nI have a good understanding of SEO and how to write in such a way that the piece will not only be SEO friendly and boost your conversion rates but will also engage the reader and keep them entertained.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me with your requirements.", "24/7"]}}, {"id": 20, "user": {"name": "Sohel Rahaman SR", "metadata": ["Bengaluru, Karnataka, India", "Bengaluru,", "Karnataka,", "India", "595\n/yr", "595", "/yr", "\u00b7", "100%"], "avatar": "https://res.cloudinary.com/gurucom/image/upload/w_96,h_96,f_auto,dpr_2/pimg/3/062/3062391/myphoto_637056252252225662_guruImgLarge_5f59b7dc-51a4-495a-9c4d-663772cea04a.jpg", "description": {"mainImg": "https://res.cloudinary.com/gurucom/image/upload/f_auto,dpr_2/v1611256135/pimg/FreelancerFiles/3/062/3062391/zjxh58l9ktl1fziottqt.jpg", "title": "Google Ads Specialist", "description": ["$100/hr   \u00b7   Starting at $1,000", "Google Ads is one of the most crucial channels for your marketing channel.
