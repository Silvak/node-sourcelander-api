To develop, nurture and grow digital assets over time that continually meet customer needs.\n\nI am considered a creative suit with a passion for change. Not only do I help people see the change that\u2019s coming, I help them seize the day.\n\nTony Robbins is quoted as saying \u2013 \u201cBy changing nothing, nothing changes.\u201d \n\nDigitally, the future is all about change \u2013 how we embrace it and how we introduce it to our organizations and customers so that both are satisfied. \n\nWhat I love about the web is that it is ever changing. Technology changes. Our customers change the way they use it. Or both. While all this change is going on, our businesses can\u2019t help but be changed as well.\n\nAnd not all change is seismic. Sometimes it\u2019s incremental; sometimes it\u2019s just a little change that\u2019s needed to delight a customer. Yet because it\u2019s small, sometimes we forget, or we let it go to next time. But there is no next time.\n\nManaging this type of change is not easy. It requires discipline, patience and persistence. But once you start that journey, it is a heck of a ride.\n\nAs a digital consultant, I work with my clients to understand their digital environment, their customers\u2019 needs in that environment and a way to continually align both with the purpose of the organization in an ever changing digital world. \n\nIf you are interested in starting that journey, feel free to connect and I can help you take the first step\n\n\nSpecialties: \nB2B | Digital Integration | Web Development | Business Analysis and Requirements | Cross Functional Teams | User Experience | Design Management | Process Improvement | Web Analytics | User Acceptance Testing | Profiling and Personalization | Internal and External Communication | Corporate Marketing and PR | Product Management | Distribution"]}}, {"id": 2, "user": {"name": "Peter Chen", "metadata": ["Brampton, Ontario, Canada", "Brampton,", "Ontario,", "Canada"], "avatar": "https://res.cloudinary.com/gurucom/image/upload/w_96,h_96,f_auto,dpr_2/static/default-user.png", "description": {"mainImg": "https://res.cloudinary.com/gurucom/image/upload/f_auto,dpr_2/static/DefaultServiceCoverImgs/defaultsvcover_other.jpg", "title": "3d Character and Hard Surface Modeler", "description": ["$12/hr   \u00b7   Starting at $36", "I\u2019m Peter, born and raised in Taiwan.
