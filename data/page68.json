My adventure in becoming a writer has been a long journey of detours, bumps, and iffy overpasses, pretty much everything but a straight road. Every writer\u2019s path is different; some have known their whole lives they wanted to be writers, and some didn\u2019t realize until they were much older. That would be me, so trust me when I say it is never too late to start.\n\nWriting is difficult, especially since we writers tend to have a hard time sitting down to write, you know, the action that makes us writers. Unfortunately, there is no replacement for doing the work. Believe me, if I had one, I\u2019d give it to you. I\u2019d give it to everyone because I believe we all have a story to tell. That is why I started Prose Story Consulting, to help writers tell their stories and find a way to make the process easier while remembering how fun and fulfilling writing can be. I promise it can be fun again.\n\nMost writers have experienced writer\u2019s block or life circumstances that derailed projects or the dreaded imposter syndrome; it\u2019s not the worst thing to go through, but it sure can make you feel insignificant. You are not insignificant. What is the secret to continuing to sit down even when life keeps trying to pull the chair out from under you? A support system. Support from fellow writers, friends, and someone who can empathize with you while helping you continue the work. If it\u2019s not apparent, that last one is me. Saying \u201cThe End\u201d on a project, whether on paper or in your sweet, creative mind, is a great feeling, and I want to help you get there.", "I work hourly and offer packages for projects as needed.
