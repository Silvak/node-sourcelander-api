          "I have been working as a web developer / consultant for more than 7 years.\nAll the successful cases were from the remote work with the international clients. Thus, I always preferred remote collaboration with a flexible working hours and schedule.\n\nI put special emphasis on the architectural traits of the code I write. That's why I consider myself as a software architect rather than a developer.\nSuch advocacy towards the architectural excellency made me a pro-developer on MVC/MVVM frameworks both on the front-end and the back-end.\n\nPersonally, I am easy-going, open-minded, collaborative and highly-disciplined at the same time.\nTeam-work is what I like the most, it is simply awesome to work with the top-notch brains world-wide.\n\nI am a big fan of \"The magic of thinking big\", written by Schwartz. And it helps me keep a big picture in my mind regardless of whatever role I take in the projects.\n\nI am sure that you will enjoy every moment of working with me.\nI look forward to working with you, soon.\n\nRegards",
          "I am able to work on EST work hours and European work hours.\nI am working at home, thus scheduling a day is quite a flexible process for me.\nMy past contracts with US, Canadian and German clients went really well, especially in terms of communication."
