          "I specialize in two categories, Web / Cross Platform Applications and Linux System Administration.\n\nCross Platform / Web Applications :\nI commonly use React, Angular, Vue, Node.js, Laravel, Symfony, React Native, Ionic, MySQL, MongoDB and GraphQL. I love digging into problems to inspire a custom-centric development process. My goal is to create, scale and optimize products to reach the right people. Realizing these goals, I'm motivated by working in a team that encourages questions and willingly adapts priorities.\n\nLinux System Administration :\nI run DNS, Database, Web, API, Virtualization, and Application Servers. I am proficient in Bash and understand Linux very well. I usually use Ubuntu based AWS EC2 or DigitalOcean droplet to deploy my applications. I can take care of your mission critical data and keep it online and backed up.\n\nOther Skills :\nFirebase | Git | Jest | Enzyme | Product roadmap | Site mapping | Competitive analysis",
          "I usually work on EST hours, but can adjust to CST/PST as needed.\nI prefer hourly contracts with a rate of $65/hr."
