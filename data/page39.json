Absolutely.\nCollege graduate? Yep.\n\nMy name is Krystal, and I've been writing since I was ten, with my first work published at twelve. I was lost for a while, working on things that I lacked passion for, but the pandemic made me realize that I'll always come back to writing. I have a double major bachelors degree in History and Anthropology with a focus on Mythology and Education. I've studied in Okayama, Japan and have an Associates of Applied Sciences in Criminal Justice.  One of the places I ended up while finding myself was finance. I was good at it, and passionate about helping people, but working face to face for 10-12 hours a day wasn't where I wanted to be. Even so, I did get a Series 6, 63, and 26 licenses as well as life insurance license. I can absolutely provide my registration ID upon request. Prior to recusing myself from the industry, I had $1,000,000 Assets Under Management (AUM) over the course of the two years I spent helping middle and low income families.\n\nNow I write, just like I did in school. Beyond just writing (just, ha!) I live in an RV full time traveling the United States with my husband, two daughters, mother in law, and sister in law. (Coachmen Mirada 35bh for the win!) In approximately five years, we plan on getting a long-haul yacht and begin traveling the world too!\n\nGames, books, writing, art. These are my passions. And travel, can't forget travel! I refuse to die with regrets about how I never did anything or went anywhere or saw the world. \n\nBonus: Please, everyone who reads nonfiction, check out The Power of Habit! \n\nI read all the things.
